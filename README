First install GraphViz
Then compile(if not already compiled in your system) and run the executable file.
This will create .gv file.
Then in the command line type this $ dot -Tpng tree.gv -o tree.png and hit enter.
This will create the png file.
Note: tree.gv and tree.png are the names that I am using..you may want to choose a 
different name
